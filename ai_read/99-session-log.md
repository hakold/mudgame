## 2026-05-14 12:10
- Goal: establish a reliable AI collaboration reading area in the repository root.
- Changes: created `ai_read` folder with overview, current-state, known-issues, roadmap, and this session log.
- Files: `ai_read/README.md`, `ai_read/01-project-overview.md`, `ai_read/02-current-state.md`, `ai_read/03-known-issues.md`, `ai_read/04-roadmap.md`, `ai_read/99-session-log.md`.
- Validation: reviewed current project structure, routes, player controller, client store, and recent gameplay fixes before writing docs.
- Remaining risks: the docs capture the current understanding, but they should be updated whenever a major system is refactored or a gameplay loop is verified end-to-end.

## 2026-05-14 12:35
- Goal: start Phase 1 stabilization by fixing model mismatches and loading real player data into the client.
- Changes: unified socket-side stat training to use `user.attributes`; removed duplicate effective skill-learning flow in favor of a single handler; aligned skill-learning room checks with both `train` and `learn_skill`; updated learnable skill filtering; added client-side loading and refreshing for user, inventory, skills, and quests; wired the game view to load these datasets on entry.
- Files: `server/src/game/index.js`, `server/src/socket/index.js`, `client/src/stores/game.js`, `client/src/views/Game.vue`, `ai_read/99-session-log.md`.
- Validation: `node --check server/src/socket/index.js`, `node --check server/src/game/index.js`, and `npm run build` in `client/` all passed.
- Remaining risks: battle/quest progression remains shallow, and the deeper skill execution model is still not fully consistent with `skills.json`.

## 2026-05-14 12:55
- Goal: improve the battle chain and fix the front-end battle HP bar overflow issue.
- Changes: added battle-side skill payload normalization and monster skill mapping; added simple monster auto-turn selection; extended battle execution to support attack/heal skills plus defend damage reduction; changed battle-end flow to return rewards with the final action result; added turn validation and room-wide battle end sync in socket logic; updated command parsing so `skill <技能ID>` works in battle; added battle skill buttons and current-turn display in the UI; clamped HP percentages and added overflow-safe bar styles.
- Files: `server/src/game/battleService.js`, `server/src/socket/index.js`, `client/src/stores/game.js`, `client/src/views/Game.vue`, `client/src/assets/main.css`, `ai_read/03-known-issues.md`, `ai_read/99-session-log.md`.
- Validation: `node --check server/src/game/battleService.js`, `node --check server/src/socket/index.js`, and `npm run build` in `client/` all passed.
- Remaining risks: advanced skill types from `skills.json` are still not fully supported, and PVP/disconnect edge cases still need dedicated testing.

## 2026-05-14 13:20
- Goal: continue supplementing battle statuses so combat is less of a black box and more aligned with existing skill config fields.
- Changes: added runtime status-effect handling in battle service for buff/debuff modifiers, burn/poison/dot, stun/freeze/fear, lifesteal, HP-cost skills, and reflect damage; added participant status summaries for the battle UI; updated battle messages to surface status events; expanded battle log round schema to preserve richer combat details; fixed mutual-defeat player state handling.
- Files: `server/src/game/battleService.js`, `server/src/models/BattleLog.js`, `client/src/stores/game.js`, `client/src/views/Game.vue`, `ai_read/02-current-state.md`, `ai_read/03-known-issues.md`, `ai_read/99-session-log.md`.
- Validation: `node --check server/src/game/battleService.js`, `node --check server/src/models/BattleLog.js`, and `npm run build` in `client/` all passed. `.vue` files were validated through the Vite build instead of `node --check`.
- Remaining risks: passive/counter-style mechanics and deeper combat balance are still incomplete, and PVP/disconnect cases still need explicit end-to-end testing.

## 2026-05-14 14:30
- Goal: fix battle UI HP bar text not centered.
- Changes: fixed `.battle-hp-text` vertical centering (`top: 5px` → `top: 50%; transform: translateY(-50%)`); removed `overflow: hidden` from `.battle-hp-bar` which clipped text at edges; added `position: absolute` to `.battle-hp-fill` so it layers correctly without overflow hidden; added `left: 0` to `.battle-hp-text` to fix horizontal offset caused by inline `<span>` default positioning; added `text-shadow` and `z-index` for readability over the fill bar; also fixed `.bar-text` (player status bar) vertical centering the same way.
- Files: `client/src/assets/main.css`.
- Validation: visual inspection confirmed text is now centered both vertically and horizontally within the HP bar.
- Remaining risks: none specific to this fix.

## 2026-05-14 17:20
- Goal: implement quest progress system so quest objectives actually advance when gameplay events happen.
- Changes: created `questProgressService.js` with `checkProgress(userId, event)` that matches quest objectives against gameplay events (kill, visit, talk, learn_skill, join_faction, buy, train, collect); wired progress checks into socket handlers for move (visit), battle_ended (kill), talk_npc (talk), learn_skill, join_faction; added `quest_progress` socket event so client gets real-time progress updates; added client-side listener for `quest_progress` that refreshes quest data and shows progress messages; fixed `complete_quest` handler using wrong field name `questConfig.reward` → `questConfig.rewards` (matching actual JSON config).
- Files: `server/src/game/questProgressService.js` (new), `server/src/socket/index.js`, `client/src/stores/game.js`.
- Validation: `node --check` passed for both server files; `npm run build` in client passed.
- Remaining risks: quest progress uses `objective.type` as the Map key, which means multiple objectives of the same type in one quest (e.g. two `kill` objectives targeting different monsters) would share a single counter — this needs a more granular key in the future. Also, `buy` and `train` objective types are not yet wired to socket events.

## 2026-05-14 18:00
- Goal: fix quest progress key collision and wire missing event types.
- Changes: changed progress Map key from `objective.type` to composite key `type:targetId` (e.g. `kill:monster_wild_boar`) via `objectiveKey()`/`eventKey()` helpers; objectives without a target (learn_skill, join_faction, train) use just the type as key; wired `buy_item` → `buy` and `train_stat` → `train` progress checks in socket handler; `buy` events pass `itemId` as target for item-specific objectives.
- Files: `server/src/game/questProgressService.js`, `server/src/socket/index.js`.
- Validation: `node --check` passed for both files.
- Remaining risks: existing quests in DB with old single-key progress data will need migration or re-acceptance; `collect` objective type is defined but no socket event triggers it yet (no loot/pickup system).

## 2026-05-14 20:00
- Goal: complete three tasks — smoke test, skill model unification, quest UI improvement.
- Changes:
  1. Smoke test: wrote `server/smoke_test.js` to verify full game loop (register→login→welcome→talk NPC→accept quest→move→battle→shop→rest). All events received correctly, no hard blockers.
  2. Skill model: rewrote `CharacterSkill.js` methods to use actual `skills.json` fields (`damage[]`, `heal[]`, `mpCost`, `cooldown`) instead of non-existent fields (`baseDamage`, `damageGrowth`, etc.). Added level scaling (+10% damage/heal, +5% cost, -0.5s cooldown per level). Added `getExpToNextLevel()`, `canLevelUp()`, `levelUp()` methods.
  3. Quest UI: added objective progress display in quest panel (e.g. "击杀 monster_wild_boar 1/3"), completed objectives shown with green strikethrough; added "领取奖励" button for completed quests; added `getQuestObjectives()` and `claimQuestReward()` functions; added CSS for `.quest-objectives`, `.quest-objective`, `.objective-done`, `.quest-reward-btn`.
  4. Train command: added `normalizeStatName()` to support Chinese input (力量→strength, 敏捷→dexterity, etc.), with helpful error message listing all valid options.
- Files: `server/smoke_test.js` (new), `server/src/models/CharacterSkill.js`, `server/src/socket/index.js`, `client/src/views/Game.vue`.
- Validation: `node --check` passed; `vite build` passed; smoke test all events received.
- Remaining risks: `collect` objective type still has no trigger; quest objective labels use raw IDs (e.g. "monster_wild_boar") instead of display names — needs a name lookup.

## 2026-05-14 21:00
- Goal: make quest objective labels show display names instead of raw IDs.
- Changes: added `targetName` injection in `game/index.js` `initGameSystems()` — after loading all configs, iterates quest objectives and resolves `monsterId/npcId/roomId/itemId` to their Chinese display names from the corresponding config; updated client `getQuestObjectives` to use `obj.targetName` instead of raw `targetId` for the label; also fixed `questStatus` to show "已接取" for `accepted` state.
- Files: `server/src/game/index.js`, `client/src/views/Game.vue`.
- Validation: `node --check` passed; `vite build` passed; verified all quest objectives resolve correctly (e.g. "击杀 野猪", "对话 村长", "到达 森林深处"). Two IDs (`item_herb`, `npc_immortal`) have no config entry yet and fall back to raw ID.
- Remaining risks: `item_herb` and `npc_immortal` don't exist in items/npcs config — content gap, not a code bug.

## 2026-05-14 21:40
- Goal: unify panel refresh rules and fill missing content configs.
- Changes:
  1. Panel refresh: replaced all partial user field updates in socket handlers with `refreshCurrentUser()` + relevant `loadInventory()`/`loadSkills()`/`loadQuests()` calls, ensuring all panels stay consistent after every gameplay event.
  2. Content consistency: added 19 missing items to `items.json` (weapon_bandit_sword, item_blood_stone, item_snow_wolf_pelt, item_ice_core, item_frozen_heart, item_toxic_gland, item_mutated_skin, weapon_poison_dragon_blade, item_sea_serpent_scale, item_coral_gem, item_magma_core, item_guard_badge, item_royal_token, weapon_demon_blade, armor_demon_armor, item_scorpion_tail, item_scorpion_venom, item_herb); added missing NPC `npc_immortal` (隐世仙人, mountain_peak) to `npcs.json`.
- Files: `client/src/stores/game.js`, `config/json/items.json`, `config/json/npcs.json`.
- Validation: JSON parse OK for both config files; `node --check` passed; `vite build` passed.
- Remaining risks: `collect` objective type still has no trigger event; some new items may need balance tuning (prices, stats).

## 2026-05-15 10:00
- Goal: Phase 2 — make systems internally consistent (config, models, runtime).
- Changes:
  1. Item schema: converted flat-field weapons/armor (`attack`, `defense`) to `stats: { attack/defense: N }` with `subtype` and `requireLevel`; fixed `item_herb` from `effect: { type: "heal" }` to `effects: [{ type: "heal_hp" }]` matching runtime expectation.
  2. Skill config: added `duration: 999` to passive buff skills (`skill_meditation`, `skill_yijinjing`); converted `skill_mingjiao_qiankun` reflectChance to `buff: { reflectDamage, duration }` matching `skill_flame_shield` pattern; fixed `monster_fairy_beast` skill ref `"skill_heal"` → `"skill_heal_basic"`; fixed `complete_quest` emit from `questConfig.reward` → `questConfig.rewards`.
  3. Quest progression: added `minLevel` check in `questProgressService` for `learn_skill` objectives; updated `learn_skill` socket handler to pass `skillRequireLevel` in the progress event.
  4. Content validation: created `server/validate_content.js` to cross-check all config references (monster drops→items, monster skills→skills, quest rewards→items, quest objectives→targets, room exits→rooms, NPC/monster roomIds, item/skill schema consistency). All checks pass with zero errors.
- Files: `config/json/items.json`, `config/json/skills.json`, `config/json/monsters.json`, `server/src/socket/index.js`, `server/src/game/questProgressService.js`, `server/validate_content.js` (new).
- Validation: all JSON configs parse OK; `node --check` passed; `vite build` passed; `validate_content.js` reports 0 issues.
- Remaining risks: `counterChance` and `mpRegen` skill fields are defined but not yet consumed by battle service (future mechanics); `collect` objective type still has no trigger.

## 2026-05-15 11:00
- Goal: Phase 3 — improve UX clarity and panel interactivity.
- Changes:
  1. Contextual room actions: added 💪训练, 📖学技能, 📜接任务 buttons that appear when the room's services include `train`, `learn_skill`/`meditate`, or `quest`.
  2. Inventory panel: replaced click-to-use with explicit 使用/装备/已装备/出售 buttons; added item description, stat display (`攻击+8`), and rarity coloring (uncommon/rare/epic by requireLevel); fixed sell to pass config `itemId` instead of MongoDB `_id`.
  3. Skill panel: added skill description, MP cost, and type tag (攻击/治疗/增益/被动); replaced raw proficiency display with level badge.
  4. Quest panel: added colored status badges (yellow/blue/green/red); added reward preview text before claiming; added "已领取奖励" state after claim.
  5. Added helper functions: `getItemDescription`, `getItemStats`, `itemRarity`, `statLabel`, `getSkillDescription`, `getSkillMpCost`, `getSkillTypeLabel`, `questStatusClass`, `getQuestRewardText`, `isConsumable`, `isEquipment`, `equipItem`, `sellItem`.
- Files: `client/src/views/Game.vue`.
- Validation: `vite build` passed.
- Remaining risks: `equipItem` reuses the `use` command which calls `use_item` — this works for consumables but the equip flow may need a dedicated `equip_item` socket event if equipment and consumable use diverge further.

## 2026-05-15 Session 3 — Phase 4 Complete

**Focus**: Complete all three batches of Phase 4 + env configuration

**Changes**:
